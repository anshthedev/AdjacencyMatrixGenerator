# 🧮 Adjacency Matrix Generator  

The **Adjacency Matrix Generator** is a Java application that visualizes graphs based on any adjacency matrix you provide. It automatically generates a graphical representation of the matrix on a **graphics panel**, allowing you to easily understand and analyze graph structures through visual feedback.

## 🚀 Features  

- 🧩 **Input any adjacency matrix** — supports nondirected graphs
- 🎨 **Automatic graph visualization** — nodes (vertices) and edges are drawn dynamically using Java’s graphics libraries.  
- 🔄 **Interactive updates** — modify the matrix to instantly see how the graph changes.  
- 💡 **Simple, educational tool** — ideal for learning or teaching graph theory concepts.

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. The program reads an adjacency matrix entered manually.
2. It creates nodes and connects them according to the matrix entries (1 = edge, 0 = no edge).  
3. The **graphics panel** displays the graph layout automatically, with labeled nodes and connecting edges.
